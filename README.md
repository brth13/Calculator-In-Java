This is a basic Calculator application built using Java and Swing. It supports arithmetic operations, parentheses, and respects mathematical operator precedence. The application is fully self-contained and does not rely on any external libraries.

Features:
-Basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /

-Parentheses for grouping expressions

-Correct operator precedence handling

-Backspace (‚Üê) and clear (C) functionality

-No external dependencies

-Built with core Java libraries only


Requirements:
Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later

How It Works:
This calculator uses a custom-built recursive descent parser to evaluate expressions entered by the user. 
It supports integer and decimal numbers, nested parentheses and operator precedence without using any third-party parser or scripting engine.
